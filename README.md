# Storage
A little app that lives in your menu bar to watch hysterically as your Mac's available storage decreases (or increases). 

**Features:**
1. Updates in 5 seconds or less periodically.
2. Open the menu to see what percentage of available storage you have left.
    (Fun Fact: The disk to the left has up to 10 bars, have 40% of storage left? You'll see 4 bars. Why not?)
3. Quickly manage your storage with System Information.
